### Code Challenge description

We would like you to create a small react application that grabs data from a REST API, and renders it in a graph. We would like to see the TotalEnergies share price charted over 5 years, 1 year, 1 month, and 1 week. You can use whatever API or plotting library you wish, although we recommend Yahoo Finance for the API and @visx for the charting. We expect the solution to be implemented using custom hooks, and have to appropriate test coverage. We expect the test should take no longer than two hours. Good luck!
